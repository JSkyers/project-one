What I used to create this game was :
HTML5
CSS3 - Bootstrap
Javascript - JQuery

The main objectives of this project were to make a game that :
* Include an instruction section explaining how to play the game.
* Ether display a message when the user has won or display the users score after the game has finished.
* Be styled to perfection!
* Be hosted online!

Over the duration of the project what I did was :
* Set out the main tasks in a trello sheet to keep track of progress.
* Created the game in 2 sprints.
* In sprint 1 I completed an MVP - a functioning game with the base mechanics
* In sprint 2 I added audio to most things that happen on the screen, background music for each page, a better user interface and I resized some of the images

How the game works :
* The game is to be played by four players
* Each player must select a character to attack
* Once each character that is still alive has selected a target, the attacks and who they are directed at will be shown and damage will be calculated
* Players must repeat this process till there is one character left
* That players character will be displayed on a victory screen
